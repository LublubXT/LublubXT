# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Caleb J. Gross. I love to program, and I have been programming since 2019. I also love to learn. One of the things that propels me on to new projects, and new things, is the fact that I love to learn, I try to read every book that I can get my hands on, and soak it all in. Science is my favorite thing to study, and improve my skills in. I like Engineering, Programming, Animals, Rockets, Airplains, Helicopters, Drones, and I think you get my point.

My programming skills include:
- Python
- Javascript
- Html
- Css
- Java
- C++
- C
- C#
- NodeJS
- ReactJS
- Bootstrap
- Mongodb

And More!



## - WebMJS - 
My latest and one of my greatest projects that I am working on is a NodeJS CMS, called **WebMJS**, which is a Node JS and Express website CMS.


The reason I am making this CMS with NodeJS and Express, is I wanted to make something that looks more modern than Wordpress, and is simpler to use. I w,ant to have two different releases, one for static websites, and another for NodeJS server websites. The one I am currently working on is the NodeJS server one, so it will only work on NodeJS servers like **Heroku**.

I have been building websites with NodeJS and Express, for a while now, and it is simple, and easier to use than PHP is. One of the things I didn't like about making themes with wordpress, is its complexity, and having to use PHP, which I am not a fan of.

I hope to have the first version out by summer of this year. It will take a lot of work, but in the end it will be very easy to use and to setup. All you need to do is import the files into your project, and add some javascript to your pug or ejs files.

## - Freelay -
Html, Javascript, and Css webpage builder, made to save hundreds of lines of code, and save hours of work.

How this works, is by clicking on an image on the right side bar, then it adds the html and css code for that image. The layouts already work for any screen size, so you dont have to worry about getting it to work on phones as well as computers. Once you have your layout done, you copy and paste the code in your IDE and you are ready to go! I still have a lot of work to do, which is listed in my Freelay Repo [here](https://github.com/LublubXT/freelay). Again if you want more info about it go to the repo, and if you have any questions about it, go the the descution page on the repo.
